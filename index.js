// Write up eight questions, each with four multiple choice options
// that will dynamically be rendered upon user interaction.

// After user completes eight questions, the score will be calculated based
// on user input and displayed on a results screen where the user will be able
// to submit their initials with their score which will be saved to an object.

// After submitting their initials, the highscore section will be rendered
// which will show all previous scores ranked in order with the corresponding
// initials. The user will then have then option to clear the highscore list and
