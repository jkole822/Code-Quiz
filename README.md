# Code-Quiz

## Description

Contains a short quiz testing the user on JavaScript fundamental, namely concepts related to Object-Oriented Programming and Web APIs. The user has 8 minutes to answer all eight questions. The timer is initialized in the upper right hand corner of the screen when the user begins the quiz. If the user answers a question incorrectly, 30 seconds are deducted from the timer. When the user finishes the quiz, or if time runs out, the user's score is calculated based on correct responses and is automatically displayed on the screen. When the score is displayed, the user has an opportunity to enter in their initials which will be saved with their score to local storage. Upon submission, the data from local storage is rendered into a highscore list which displays user initials and scores in descending order. The user has the option from the highscore screen to clear the highscore list from both the current display and local storage, as well as return to the start screen of the quiz. The option to return to the highscore screen is available to the user at any time. However, if the user chooses to visit the highscore screen during the quiz, their progress will be reset.
